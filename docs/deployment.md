# Deployment

Currently the website is deployed as a [test version](https://boisterous-axolotl-f0066f.netlify.app/) on Netlify. 

## Note
If you want to redeploy the website on Netlify, please note that Netlify treats all warnings as errors, and the website has some warnings at the moment. Therefore, you need to change CI value to false in Deployment Settings. See [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/troubleshooting-tips/#build-fails-on-warning-message).

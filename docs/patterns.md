# Coding Patterns

## Casing
This codebase will be using camel casing

## Linters / Formatters
This will automatically format your code if you install [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) in VS Code or type `yarn lint` in the specific folders.

Make sure you have installed the devDependencies so additional linters can be used.
